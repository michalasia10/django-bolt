## Django‑Bolt (experimental) ⚡️

Fast, typed HTTP APIs for Django using a Rust engine and msgspec serialization. This project is a prototype exploring how far we can push performance while keeping a simple, familiar developer experience.

### What this is 🚀

- **Rust server core**: Actix + Tokio behind the scenes, driven from Python via pyo3-asyncio.
- **Simple API syntax**: Define routes with `BoltAPI` decorators (`get/post/put/patch/delete`).
- **Typed params + body**: Function parameters are bound from path/query; request bodies decode into `msgspec.Struct`.
- **Typed responses**: Validate/serialize responses using either the function return type annotation or a `response_model=` on the decorator. Django ORM objects are automatically coerced into your `msgspec.Struct` models.
- **Batteries included**: Example project, benchmarks, and tests.

### Status ⚠️

This is an experimental project. The API is unstable and may change without notice. Do not use in production yet.


### Minimal usage 🧩

```python
import msgspec
from typing import Optional
from django_bolt import BoltAPI

api = BoltAPI()

class Item(msgspec.Struct):
    name: str
    description: Optional[str] = None
    price: float
    tax: Optional[float] = None
    tags: list[str] = []

@api.post("/items/")
async def create_item(item: Item) -> Item:
    item = ItemModel.objects.create(**item)
    return item

@api.get("/items/", response_model=list[Item]) # return type and response_model both are supprted like FastAPI
async def read_items():
    return [Item(name="Portal Gun", price=42.0), Item(name="Plumbus", price=32.0)]
```

Notes:

- If both a return annotation and `response_model` are present, `response_model` wins.
- If neither is provided, responses are returned as‑is for maximal performance.

### Why msgspec? 🚀

`msgspec` provides extremely fast type validation and JSON encoding/decoding. We lean on it for both request body parsing and response serialization.

### Caveats ⚠️

- Experimental: APIs and internals will change.
- Limited error handling: response validation errors currently return 500; this may change to 422 in the future.
- Benchmarks are local and environment‑dependent; treat numbers as indicative, not absolute.

### Contributing 🤝

Feedback, issues, and PRs are welcome. Please keep in mind the project is evolving quickly and performance is the primary goal.

#### Quick start

1. 🔧 Build the native module (uses uv + maturin):

```bash
make build
```

2. ▶️ Run the example server (multi‑process background):

```bash
make run-bg HOST=127.0.0.1 PORT=8000 WORKERS=2 P=2
# then
make smoke
```

3. ✅ Run tests:

```bash
make test-py
```

4. 📈 Run benchmarks (root, items, ORM, and Json Parsing tests):

```bash
make save-bench
# knobs: C, N, P, WORKERS, SLOW_MS, SLOW_CONC, SLOW_DURATION, WORKER_SET
```


### Benchmarks (dev) 📊

These are indicative numbers produced by `scripts/benchmark.sh` on a local machine. This is not a full web framework yet; many features like middleware, CORS, auth, etc. are not enabled in these runs. Treat results as directional only.

Summary (from BENCHMARK_DEV.md):

```
Root (GET /)
Requests per second:    64527.79

Items GET (GET /items/1?q=hello)
Requests per second:    67866.55

Items PUT JSON (PUT /items/1)
Requests per second:    61265.50

ORM Full10 (GET /users/full10)
Requests per second:     7507.36

ORM Mini10 (GET /users/mini10)
Requests per second:     8944.02

JSON Parse/Validate (POST /bench/parse)
Requests per second:     37599.87
```

See the full details in `BENCHMARK_DEV.md`. Your results will vary by hardware and settings (`P`, `WORKERS`, `C`, `N`, etc.).
